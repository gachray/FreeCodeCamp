            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>Alan Turing is best known for his work during World War II at Bletchley Park, where he played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages, which is believed to have shortened the war. He also formalized the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine.</p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Despite his contributions to the war effort and to the field of computer science, Turing was persecuted for his homosexuality and ultimately died by suicide in 1954. In 2009, the British government formally apologized for his treatment, and in 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon.</p>
